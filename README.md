# Bitcoin-Is-Not-A-Cryptocurrency
Bitcoin is not a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic version of cash. The cryptocurrency is regulated by a sort of authority, a mandatory system, or a group of people. But bitcoin is not controlled by anything like that. Bitcoin was a successful attempt towards freedom but not the first. Every cryptocurrency we see is somehow compromised. The term currency is not appropriate for bitcoin. Bitcoin does not maintain any fiat obligatory policy. Bitcoin has a consistent and changeable set of rules to follow. Bitcoin does not assist by a central authority and does not follow any mandatory discreetness like fiat money. Bitcoin does not control by a central authority nor has any decentralized influence. Bitcoin has R2, S2F, S2FX, and other models. We know the supply of bitcoin and miners mine bitcoin but no one does not make it or issue it or print digitally it like currencies. Cryptocurrencies are not as decentralized as bitcoin. Cryptocurrency does not have a fixed supply as they had promise. In ancient times people trade goods with goods. It doesn't mean that the goods we are exchanging with are a currency. Alike, we can say that bitcoin is not a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is a digital asset, and its behavior is just like an asset. So bitcoin is an asset class. Do not trust, verify it.
